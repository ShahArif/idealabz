-- FINAL RLS FIX for idea_documents table
-- This script will completely disable RLS temporarily, then set up ultra-permissive policies

-- Step 1: DIAGNOSE - Check current state
SELECT '=== CURRENT STATE ===' as info;

-- Check if table exists and its current state
SELECT

-- Step 2: COMPLETELY DISABLE RLS TO TEST
